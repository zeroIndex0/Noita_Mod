## NOTE:  

This mod will most likely NOT play nice with other Noita mods because I imported *player.xml* into the mod in order  
to change the player loadout when spawned into the game.  If other mods rely on the *player.xml* file, then this addon  
will most likely not play nice.  I created this mainly because I was annoyed at the poor RNG in the game combined with  
far too many enemies one shotting you.  I did, however, get a little carried away with the power :)
